# National Insurance (Bituach Leumi / ביטוח לאומי) -- Severance Rules

## Overview

The National Insurance Institute of Israel (המוסד לביטוח לאומי / Bituach Leumi) administers social security contributions, which cover old-age pensions, disability, unemployment, and other benefits. When an individual ceases Israeli residency, specific rules govern the **severance of Bituach Leumi obligations**, **voluntary continuation options**, and the **impact on accrued pension rights**.

This file also addresses the interaction with the **Cyprus social security system** and any applicable bilateral social security agreements.

---

## 1. Payment Obligations During Israeli Residency

### 1.1 Who Must Pay

All **Israeli residents** aged 18 and above are required to pay National Insurance contributions, regardless of whether they have income.

| Category | Contribution Basis | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Employed | Percentage of salary (employer + employee split) | Employer deducts at source |
| Self-employed | Percentage of taxable income | Monthly advance payments |
| Not employed (no income) | Minimum flat-rate contribution | Bituach Leumi issues payment books |

### 1.2 Contribution Rates (2025/2026)

| Income Bracket | Employee Rate | Employer Rate | Self-Employed Rate |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Up to 60% of average wage (NIS [PLACEHOLDER]) | 3.5% NI + 0.4% health = **3.9%** | **3.55%** | **2.87%** |
| 60% -- 100% of average wage | **12.0%** (NI) + **5.0%** (health) = **17.0%** [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm] | **7.60%** [PLACEHOLDER] | **16.23%** [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Above maximum insurable income | No contributions above ceiling | Same | Same |

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm all contribution rates and income brackets for the 2026 tax year. Rates are updated annually. The maximum insurable income for 2026 is NIS [PLACEHOLDER] per month. -->

### 1.3 Health Insurance (ביטוח בריאות)

Health insurance contributions are collected together with National Insurance. Cessation of residency affects health insurance coverage -- see Section 2.3 below.

---

## 2. Severance Process and Timing

### 2.1 When Obligations Cease

National Insurance payment obligations cease when an individual is **no longer an Israeli resident** for Bituach Leumi purposes. Importantly, Bituach Leumi applies its **own residency test**, which may differ from the Tax Ordinance definition:

- Bituach Leumi residency is based on **habitual residence** (מקום מגורים קבוע).
- In practice, Bituach Leumi often follows the ITA's residency determination but is not bound by it.
- Physical departure from Israel alone is **not sufficient** -- the individual must demonstrate they have established habitual residence elsewhere.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the current relationship between ITA residency determination and Bituach Leumi residency. Are there cases where Bituach Leumi continued to treat an individual as resident after the ITA accepted non-residency? -->

### 2.2 Notification Process

| Step | Description | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Notify Bituach Leumi of departure | Within [PLACEHOLDER] days of departure |
| 2 | Submit supporting documentation | Departure tickets, foreign lease, foreign employment contract |
| 3 | Bituach Leumi review | [PLACEHOLDER] weeks/months |
| 4 | Confirmation of non-residency | Written confirmation from Bituach Leumi |
| 5 | Cessation of obligations | Effective from the departure date (retroactive if approved) |

> **Practical note:** Bituach Leumi may not issue a formal "confirmation of non-residency" promptly. Many practitioners report delays of 6-12 months. During this period, the individual should retain evidence of their departure and new residency.

### 2.3 Impact on Health Insurance

- Upon cessation of Bituach Leumi residency, the individual **loses Israeli public health insurance coverage**.
- Coverage typically continues for a **grace period** of [PLACEHOLDER -- 2 months? 3 months?] after departure.
- The individual must obtain health insurance in Cyprus (either through employment, private insurance, or the Cyprus General Healthcare System / GeSY).

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the health insurance grace period and whether it has changed post-2020. -->

---

## 3. Voluntary Continuation Options

### 3.1 Voluntary Insurance (ביטוח מרצון)

Israeli nationals who cease residency may **elect to continue paying National Insurance contributions voluntarily** to preserve certain benefit entitlements.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Eligibility | Israeli nationals (citizens) who were residents immediately before departure |
| Benefits covered | Old-age pension; disability (partial); survivors' benefits |
| Benefits NOT covered | Unemployment; maternity; work injury; health insurance |
| Contribution amount | Flat rate: NIS [PLACEHOLDER] per month (2026) |
| Payment method | Direct bank transfer or credit card; can be arranged before departure |
| Enrollment deadline | Must enroll within [PLACEHOLDER -- 5 years?] of departure |

### 3.2 Advantages of Voluntary Continuation

- **Preserves old-age pension eligibility:** The individual continues to accrue qualifying months toward the old-age pension (קצבת זקנה).
- **Disability coverage:** Partial disability insurance continues (subject to conditions).
- **Low cost:** The voluntary contribution is typically much lower than mandatory contributions.

### 3.3 Disadvantages / Considerations

- **No health insurance:** Voluntary insurance does NOT include Israeli health insurance.
- **No unemployment:** Not relevant for individuals living abroad, but worth noting.
- **Double contributions:** The individual may also be required to pay social security contributions in Cyprus, resulting in potential double payment.
- **Bilateral agreement:** An Israel-Cyprus social security agreement may mitigate double contributions (see Section 5).

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the current voluntary contribution rate for 2026 and the enrollment deadline. Also confirm whether the benefits under voluntary insurance have changed recently. -->

---

## 4. Impact on Pension Rights

### 4.1 Old-Age Pension (קצבת זקנה)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Eligibility age | Men: 67; Women: 62-65 (gradually increasing) [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm 2026 ages] |
| Minimum qualifying period | 144 months (12 years) of contributions, including at least 60 months in the last 10 years before pension age [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm] |
| Pension amount | Base amount + increment for each year of contributions beyond the minimum |
| Payment abroad | Old-age pension **can be paid abroad** to former residents |
| Currency | Paid in NIS; can be deposited in Israeli or foreign bank account |

### 4.2 Effect of Departure on Pension Calculation

- **Contributions made during residency** count toward the qualifying period.
- **Voluntary contributions** made after departure also count.
- **Gap years** (after departure, without voluntary contributions) do **not** count and may jeopardize eligibility if the minimum qualifying period is not met.
- Individuals who leave Israel after a long career typically have sufficient qualifying months. The risk is primarily for **younger departing residents** who may not have accumulated 144 months.

### 4.3 Pension for Returning Residents

If the individual later returns to Israel and re-establishes residency, contributions resume and are added to the prior qualifying period. There is no penalty for the gap period (other than non-accrual).

## 5. Interaction with Cyprus Social Security

### 5.1 Cyprus Social Insurance System

Cyprus operates a social insurance system under the **Social Insurance Law (Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων)**:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Contributions | Employee: 8.3%; Employer: 8.3%; Self-employed: 15.6% [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm 2026 rates] |
| Benefits | Old-age pension, sickness, maternity, unemployment, work injury |
| Healthcare | Separate system: GeSY (General Healthcare System); contribution: 2.65% employee + 2.90% employer [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Qualifying period | Minimum 15 years of contributions for full pension [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm] |

### 5.2 Israel-Cyprus Bilateral Social Security Agreement

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the existence, terms, and current status of an Israel-Cyprus bilateral social security agreement. Key questions:

1. Does such an agreement exist? If so, confirm the signing and effective dates.
2. Does it provide for totalization (aggregation of qualifying periods in both countries)?
3. Does it prevent double contributions (detachment provisions for temporary assignments)?
4. Does it address pension portability (export of pensions)?

If no bilateral agreement exists, note this and address whether the EU regulation on social security coordination (Regulation 883/2004) applies to Israeli nationals. -->

| Agreement Aspect | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| Agreement exists | [PLACEHOLDER -- Yes/No] |
| Totalization of periods | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Prevention of double contributions | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Pension export provisions | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Effective date | [PLACEHOLDER] |

### 5.3 Practical Implications for Relocators

**If a bilateral agreement exists:**
- Qualifying periods in Israel and Cyprus can be **combined (totalized)** to meet minimum pension eligibility in either country.
- A **detachment certificate** may be available for temporary assignments (typically up to 24 months) to avoid double contributions.
- Pensions earned in Israel can be **exported** to Cyprus and vice versa.

**If no bilateral agreement exists:**
- The individual may need to pay social security in **both countries** simultaneously (if maintaining any Israeli connection that triggers Bituach Leumi).
- Qualifying periods in one country cannot be used to satisfy the minimum in the other.
- The individual should **maximize voluntary Israeli contributions** to reach the 144-month threshold before departure if they are close.

## 7. Key Interactions

- **Residency Determination:** Bituach Leumi residency may diverge from tax residency under `01-israeli-tax-residency.md`. Both must be addressed separately.
- **Timeline Planning:** NI severance should be coordinated with the exit tax timeline in `02-exit-tax-section-100a.md`.
- **Cyprus Employment:** Employment in Cyprus triggers Cyprus social insurance. See `03-cyprus-corporate-framework.md` for company setup.
- **Reporting:** NI status may be relevant to Israeli tax filings. See `06-reporting-obligations.md`.
