# Cyprus Banking & Mortgage Framework

## Overview

Opening bank accounts and obtaining mortgage financing in Cyprus involves navigating **KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering)** requirements that are particularly stringent for non-EU nationals and new residents. This file codifies the practical rules, documentation requirements, and typical terms that apply to Israeli nationals relocating to Cyprus.

---

## 1. Bank Account Opening -- Non-Residents / New Residents

### 1.1 Eligible Banks

The main commercial banks operating in Cyprus include:

| Bank | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Bank of Cyprus (BoC) | Largest domestic bank; most experience with Israeli clients |
| Hellenic Bank | Second largest; generally receptive to non-EU clients |
| Eurobank Cyprus | Subsidiary of Greek Eurobank |
| AstroBank | Smaller; may have longer processing times |
| Alpha Bank Cyprus | Greek-origin; selective client acceptance |

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm which banks are currently actively accepting Israeli national account openings. Market reports suggest periodic policy changes. -->

### 1.2 Account Types

- **Personal current account** (EUR, USD, ILS)
- **Business/corporate account** (requires company registration -- see LTF-03)
- **Savings/term deposit account**
- **Investment account** (subject to MiFID II suitability assessment)

### 1.3 Timeline

- Personal account: **2-6 weeks** from submission of complete documentation
- Corporate account: **4-12 weeks** (longer due to UBO verification)
- Delays common for Israeli nationals due to enhanced due diligence (EDD) requirements [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm current average timelines]

---

## 2. KYC/AML Documentation Requirements

**Legal Source:** Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering Activities Law (L.188(I)/2007, as amended); Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) Directive on AML/CFT.

### 2.3 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Triggers

Banks apply EDD procedures when:

- Client is a **Politically Exposed Person (PEP)** or related/associated person
- Source country is on EU/FATF high-risk list [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm Israel's current classification]
- Transaction patterns suggest complexity inconsistent with declared business
- Client holds dual nationality including a high-risk jurisdiction
- Cash-intensive businesses

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Israeli nationals are generally subject to standard (not enhanced) due diligence, but some banks apply EDD as a blanket policy for non-EU nationals. Confirm current practice at major banks. -->

---

## 3. Mortgage Eligibility for Non-EU Nationals with Cyprus Residency

### 3.1 General Eligibility

Non-EU nationals who have obtained **Cyprus residency** (either through immigration permit, permanent residency, or Cyprus Investment Programme legacy status) are eligible for mortgage financing from Cypriot banks.

Key eligibility factors:

- **Residency status:** Valid Cyprus residence permit (temporary or permanent)
- **Income verification:** Documented income sufficient to service the mortgage
- **Property type:** Residential property in Cyprus
- **Employment basis:** Employed in Cyprus, self-employed with Cyprus company, or foreign-employed with verifiable income

### 3.2 Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios

| Buyer Profile | Typical LTV | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Cyprus/EU citizen -- primary residence | Up to 80% | Standard terms |
| Non-EU with permanent residency -- primary | Up to 70% | Subject to income verification |
| Non-EU with temporary residency -- primary | Up to 60-65% | Bank-dependent; higher deposit required |
| Investment property (any buyer) | Up to 50-60% | More conservative underwriting |

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm current LTV caps. These vary by bank and market conditions. The ranges above are indicative based on 2024-2025 market data. -->

### 3.3 Interest Rates (Typical Ranges)

| Rate Type | Typical Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Variable rate (ECB + spread) | ECB rate + 2.5% -- 4.0% | Most common; resets with ECB decisions |
| Fixed rate (1-5 years) | 3.5% -- 5.5% | Limited availability; higher than variable |
| Fixed rate (5+ years) | 4.5% -- 6.0% | Rare; not all banks offer |

> **Note:** Rates are indicative as of early 2026. ECB base rate is [PLACEHOLDER -- insert current ECB rate]. Rates for non-EU borrowers are typically at the **higher end** of ranges.

### 3.4 Loan Terms

| Parameter | Typical Terms |
|-----------|--------------|
| Maximum term | 25-30 years |
| Maximum age at maturity | 65-70 years |
| Currency | EUR (some banks allow USD) |

| Maximum loan amount | Bank-dependent; typically up to EUR 2,000,000 for residential |
| Arrangement fee | 0.5% -- 1.0% of loan amount |
| Valuation fee | EUR 300 -- EUR 800 |
| Early repayment penalty | Variable: none; Fixed: typically 1-2% of prepaid amount |

## 4. Foreign Income Documentation

For borrowers whose income is primarily from **outside Cyprus** (common for Israeli relocators in transition):

### 4.1 Accepted Income Sources

| Income Source | Documentation Required |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Israeli employment (during transition) | Employment contract, payslips (6-12 months), Form 106 |
| Israeli business income | Audited financials, tax returns (Form 1301), accountant letter |
| Rental income (Israel/abroad) | Lease agreements, bank statements showing receipts |
| Investment income | Portfolio statements, dividend certificates |
| Cyprus employment (post-relocation) | Employment contract, payslips |
| Cyprus company income | Company financials, director's remuneration resolution |
| Global remote employment | Employment contract, payslips, employer verification letter |

### 4.2 Currency and Exchange Considerations

- Income in **NIS or USD** is acceptable but banks apply a **haircut** (typically 10-20%) when converting to EUR-equivalent debt service capacity.
- Banks may require income to be **deposited into a Cypriot account** for a period (typically 3-6 months) before considering it for mortgage qualification.
- **Foreign currency risk** is assessed by the bank; they may require a higher deposit or lower LTV for borrowers with non-EUR income.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether banks currently apply specific NIS haircut percentages or a general non-EUR discount. -->

## 6. Key Interactions

- **Cyprus Company Formation:** Corporate accounts require an established company (see `03-cyprus-corporate-framework.md`).
- **Residency Status:** Mortgage eligibility depends on immigration permit type (cross-reference with immigration framework files).
- **Reporting:** Bank accounts opened in Cyprus trigger CRS reporting to Israel. See `06-reporting-obligations.md`.
- **Tax Treaty:** Interest paid on Cyprus mortgage may have treaty implications. See `05-tax-treaties-israel-cyprus.md`.
