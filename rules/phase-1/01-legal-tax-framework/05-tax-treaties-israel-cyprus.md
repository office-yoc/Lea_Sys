# Israel-Cyprus Tax Treaty Provisions

## Overview

Israel and Cyprus have a **Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital**. This treaty is the cornerstone of cross-border tax planning for individuals and companies operating between the two jurisdictions.

**Treaty signed:** [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm exact signing date]
**Effective date:** [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm effective date and protocol amendments]
**Model basis:** Largely follows the OECD Model Tax Convention, with modifications.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the current treaty text in force, including any protocols or amendments. Verify whether a new treaty or protocol has been signed/ratified post-2020. -->

## 1. Treaty Residency and Tie-Breaker Rules (Article 4)

### 1.1 Treaty Residency

A person is a resident of a Contracting State if they are **liable to tax therein** by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criterion.

### 1.2 Tie-Breaker for Individuals (Article 4(2))

When an individual is resident under the domestic law of **both** Israel and Cyprus, the following tie-breaker cascade applies:

| Priority | Test | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Permanent home** (בית קבע) | Where the individual has a permanent home available. If in both states, proceed to next test. |
| 2 | **Centre of vital interests** (מרכז האינטרסים החיוניים) | State with which personal and economic relations are closer. |
| 3 | **Habitual abode** (מקום מגורים רגיל) | Where the individual habitually lives. |
| 4 | **Nationality** (אזרחות) | Nationality of the individual. |
| 5 | **Mutual Agreement** | If none of the above resolves, the competent authorities decide by mutual agreement. |

> **Critical for relocation planning:** An individual who has severed their Israeli permanent home and established a permanent home in Cyprus will generally be treated as a **Cyprus resident** for treaty purposes, even if Israel still considers them resident under domestic law (e.g., during the transition year).

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether the 2025 Israeli reform (irrebuttable presumptions) affects the treaty tie-breaker. Under international law, the treaty should prevail (Section 196 of the Tax Ordinance), but the ITA may take a different position. -->

### 1.3 Tie-Breaker for Companies (Article 4(3))

A company that is resident in both states is deemed resident where its **place of effective management** is situated.

[PLACEHOLDER -- confirm whether the treaty includes the updated OECD provision for mutual agreement on corporate dual residency, or retains the traditional POEM test.]

## 2. Dividends (Article 10)

### 2.1 Withholding Tax Rates

| Scenario | Maximum WHT Rate | Conditions |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Portfolio dividends | **15%** | General rate |
| Substantial holding dividends | **5%** | Beneficial owner holds >= 10% of capital of the paying company |
| Government / central bank | **0%** | Dividends paid to government or central bank of the other state |

### 2.2 Practical Application

- **Israel to Cyprus:** Israeli company paying dividends to Cyprus-resident shareholder: WHT capped at 5% (if >= 10% holding) or 15%.
- **Cyprus to Israel:** Cyprus company paying dividends to Israel-resident shareholder: Cyprus imposes **0% WHT** domestically (no WHT on outbound dividends regardless of treaty), so treaty rate is not the binding constraint.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the 5%/15% rates against the actual treaty text. Some sources cite 10%/15%. Verify whether any protocol has amended Article 10. -->

---

## 3. Interest (Article 11)

### 3.1 Withholding Tax Rates

| Scenario | Maximum WHT Rate | Conditions |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| General interest | **10%** | Arm's length interest between unrelated parties |
| Bank interest | **5%** | Interest paid to a bank of the other state |
| Government interest | **0%** | Interest paid to / guaranteed by the government |

### 3.2 Practical Application

- **Cyprus to Israel:** Cyprus company paying interest to Israeli lender: WHT capped at 10% (or 5% if lender is a bank).
- **Israel to Cyprus:** Israeli borrower paying interest to Cyprus lender: WHT capped at 10%/5%. [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm Israeli domestic WHT on interest to non-residents and interaction with treaty]

---

## 4. Royalties (Article 12)

### 4.1 Withholding Tax Rates

| Scenario | Maximum WHT Rate | Conditions |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| General royalties | **10%** | For the use of, or the right to use, patents, trademarks, know-how, etc. |
| Copyright royalties (literary, artistic, scientific) | **5%** | [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm whether a reduced rate applies to copyright royalties] |

### 4.2 Practical Application

- Relevant for **IP structures** where a Cyprus IP-holding company licenses IP to an Israeli operating company.
- The royalty rate interacts with the Cyprus **IP Box regime** (LTF-03-002): royalty income received by the Cyprus company may be taxed at an effective 3% rate.
- **Transfer pricing:** Royalty payments must be at arm's length. The ITA actively scrutinizes Israel-Cyprus royalty arrangements.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the copyright vs. general royalty rate distinction. Also confirm whether the ITA has issued specific guidance or rulings on Israel-Cyprus royalty arrangements. -->

---

## 5. Capital Gains (Article 13)

### 5.1 Allocation of Taxing Rights

| Asset Type | Taxing Right | Treaty Provision |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Immovable property | State where property is situated | Article 13(1) |
| Movable property of a PE | State where PE is situated | Article 13(2) |
| Ships and aircraft | State of effective management of enterprise | Article 13(3) |
| Shares deriving >50% value from immovable property | State where property is situated | Article 13(4) [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm if this provision exists in the Israel-Cyprus treaty] |
| **All other assets** | **State of residence of the alienator** | Article 13(5) |

### 5.2 Critical Implication for Exit Tax

Article 13(5) is the most relevant provision for relocation planning:

- If an individual is a **Cyprus treaty resident** (per the tie-breaker), gains on shares, securities, and other movable property are taxable **only in Cyprus**.
- This means that once treaty residency shifts to Cyprus, Israel's right to tax capital gains on non-Israeli-immovable-property assets is **limited**.
- However, the Israeli **exit tax (Section 100A)** crystallizes the gain as of the departure date -- before the individual becomes a Cyprus treaty resident. The interaction between exit tax timing and treaty protection is a key planning consideration.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether the Israel-Cyprus treaty contains a specific provision addressing exit taxes or deemed dispositions. Some modern treaties include such clauses; older ones may not. -->

---

## 6. Employment Income (Article 15)

### 6.1 General Rule

Employment income is taxable in the **state where the employment is exercised**.

### 6.2 Short-Term Assignment Exemption

Employment income is taxable **only in the state of residence** if all three conditions are met:

1. The individual is present in the other state for **no more than 183 days** in any twelve-month period;
2. The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is **not a resident** of the other state;
3. The remuneration is **not borne by a PE** of the employer in the other state.

### 6.3 Practical Application

- **Remote work from Cyprus for Israeli employer:** If the individual is a Cyprus treaty resident working remotely for an Israeli company, the employment income is generally taxable in Cyprus (where the employment is exercised), not Israel.
- **Business trips to Israel:** Short visits to Israel may not trigger Israeli tax if the 183-day and employer conditions are met.
- **Israeli employer with Cyprus PE:** If the Israeli employer has a PE in Cyprus, the exemption may not apply.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the 183-day counting method in the Israel-Cyprus treaty -- is it calendar year, tax year, or rolling 12-month period? OECD model uses 12-month period, but bilateral treaties vary. -->

---

## 7. Mutual Agreement Procedure (Article 25)

### 7.1 Overview

Where a person considers that the actions of one or both Contracting States result in taxation not in accordance with the treaty, they may present their case to the **competent authority** of the state of which they are a resident.

### 7.2 Key Features

- Must be presented within **3 years** from the first notification of the action giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the treaty. [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm time limit]
- Competent authorities shall endeavour to resolve the case by mutual agreement.
- The treaty [PLACEHOLDER -- does / does not] include a mandatory arbitration clause.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether the Israel-Cyprus treaty includes a mandatory arbitration provision (Article 25(5) of the OECD Model). Many older Israeli treaties do not. -->
