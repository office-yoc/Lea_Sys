# Cyprus Corporate & Tax Framework

## Overview

Cyprus offers a well-established corporate and tax framework that is frequently used in international tax planning, particularly for individuals relocating from Israel. This file codifies the key rules governing **company formation**, **corporate taxation**, **IP Box regime**, **non-domicile status**, and **economic substance requirements** under Cypriot law.

All rates and thresholds below reflect the **Pillar Two-aligned reforms** effective January 1, 2026, unless otherwise noted.

---

## 1. Company Formation

**Legal Source:** Cyprus Companies Law, Cap. 113 (as amended).

### 1.1 Entity Types

| Entity Type | Key Features | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Private Limited Company (Ltd) | Limited liability, 1+ shareholders, 1+ directors | Standard holding / trading vehicle |
| Public Limited Company (PLC) | Suitable for capital markets | Rarely used in relocation planning |
| Branch of Foreign Company | No separate legal personality | Used for specific treaty planning |
| Limited Partnership (LP) | General + limited partners | Fund structures |
| Variable Capital Investment Company (VCIC) | New regime for investment funds | <!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm VCIC availability and regulatory status --> |

### 1.2 Formation Requirements

- **Registered office:** Must maintain a registered office in Cyprus.
- **Secretary:** A company secretary is required (can be a corporate entity).
- **Directors:** At least one director. For tax residency of the company, a **majority of directors must be Cyprus tax resident** (effective management and control test).
- **Shareholders:** Minimum one; can be natural person or legal entity.
- **Share capital:** No minimum (commonly EUR 1,000 -- EUR 5,000 in practice).
- **Registration timeline:** 5-10 business days with the Registrar of Companies.
- **Annual levy:** EUR 350 per year.

### 1.3 Corporate Tax Residency

A company is **Cyprus tax resident** if its **management and control (διοίκηση και έλεγχος)** is exercised in Cyprus. Key factors:

- Majority of board meetings held in Cyprus
- Majority of directors resident in Cyprus
- Strategic decisions made in Cyprus

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether the 2025/2026 reforms introduced a statutory registration-based residency test as an alternative to management and control. Some EU jurisdictions have adopted dual tests. -->

---

## 2. Corporate Tax

### 2.1 Standard Rate

**Corporate income tax: 15%** (effective January 1, 2026; increased from 12.5%).

This increase aligns Cyprus with the **OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax** (GloBE rules). Groups with consolidated revenue below EUR 750 million may still benefit from an effective rate below 15% in certain structures. [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm transitional provisions for existing companies]

### 2.2 Key Features

- **Dividend income:** Generally exempt from corporate tax (participation exemption).
- **Capital gains:** Exempt, except for gains on disposal of immovable property located in Cyprus or shares in companies that directly hold Cyprus immovable property.
- **Interest income:** Taxable at 15%; reduced via IP Box or treasury management structures.
- **No withholding tax** on dividends, interest, or royalties paid by a Cyprus company to non-residents (subject to EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive / ATAD provisions).
- **Notional Interest Deduction (NID):** Deduction on new equity introduced into the company, calculated at reference rate + 5%. <!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm NID reference rate for 2026 and whether the NID survives the Pillar Two reforms. -->

---

## 3. IP Box Regime

**Legal Source:** Section 9(1)(m) of the Income Tax Law, as amended; aligned with OECD Modified Nexus Approach.

### 3.1 Effective Rate

**IP Box effective rate: 3%** (up from 2.5% prior to January 1, 2026).

### 3.2 Qualifying Assets

- Patents
- Copyrighted software
- Other legally protected IP (utility models, plant variety rights)
- **Excluded:** Marketing-related IP (trademarks, brand names)

### 3.3 Nexus Fraction

```
Qualifying Expenditure / Total Expenditure x Overall IP Income = IP Box Income
```

- **Qualifying expenditure:** R&D performed in-house or by unrelated parties.
- **Non-qualifying:** Acquisition costs of IP, outsourced R&D to related parties (unless subject to mark-up).
- **30% uplift** on qualifying expenditure (capped at total expenditure).

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether the nexus fraction calculation changed in the 2026 amendments. -->

---

## 4. Non-Domicile (Non-Dom) Status

**Legal Source:** Special Defence Contribution Law (SDC), as amended 2015 and 2025.

### 4.1 Eligibility

An individual who is **tax resident** in Cyprus but **not domiciled** in Cyprus qualifies for non-dom status.

- **Domicile of origin:** Determined at birth (father's domicile for those born in wedlock; mother's for others).
- **Domicile of choice:** Acquired by establishing permanent home in Cyprus with intention to remain indefinitely.
- An individual **not born to a Cypriot-domiciled parent** and who has **not been resident in Cyprus for 17+ of the last 20 years** qualifies as non-dom.

### 4.2 Duration

**Non-dom status: 17 years**, extendable to **27 years** under 2025 reform provisions.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm the 27-year extension mechanics. Is it automatic? Does it require an application? Are there conditions (e.g., minimum employment, investment)? -->

### 4.3 Benefits

Non-dom individuals are **exempt from Special Defence Contribution (SDC)** on:

- Dividend income (worldwide)
- Interest income (worldwide)
- Rental income (worldwide) [PLACEHOLDER -- confirm whether rental exemption applies or whether it is limited]

---

## 5. Special Defence Contribution (SDC)

### 5.1 Rates (Post-2026 Reform)

| Income Type | SDC Rate (Domiciled) | SDC Rate (Non-Dom) | Prior Rate (Domiciled) |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Dividends | **5%** | **Exempt** | 17% |
| Interest | 30% | **Exempt** | 30% |
| Rental income (75% of gross) | 3% | **Exempt** | 3% |

> **Major change:** The SDC on dividends for domiciled individuals has been **reduced from 17% to 5%** effective January 1, 2026. This significantly changes the calculus for individuals approaching the 17/27-year non-dom limit.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm exact effective date and transitional rules for the 17% to 5% reduction. Some sources cite a phased reduction. -->

---

## 6. Loss Carry-Forward

**Loss carry-forward period: 7 years** (increased from 5 years, effective January 1, 2026).

- Group relief (surrender of losses between group companies) remains available for companies in a 75% common ownership group.
- Losses from one source can be offset against income from another source in the same year.

---

## 7. Deemed Dividend Distribution -- ABOLISHED

The deemed dividend distribution rule (Section 3(4) of the SDC Law), which previously required Cypriot-resident companies to distribute a deemed dividend equal to 70% of after-tax profits within two years of the end of the relevant year, has been **abolished** effective January 1, 2026.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm that the abolition is complete and unconditional. Are there transitional provisions for deemed dividends that had already accrued but were not yet distributed? -->

---

## 8. Economic Substance Requirements

### 8.1 General Principles

Cyprus companies must demonstrate **adequate economic substance** to benefit from treaty access, EU Directives, and domestic tax incentives. This includes:

| Substance Factor | Description | Data Field Ref |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Physical office | Maintained premises in Cyprus (not just registered address) | DR-10-001 |
| Employees | Qualified staff performing core income-generating activities | DR-10-002 |
| Decision-making | Board meetings and strategic decisions in Cyprus | DR-10-003 |
| Expenditure | Proportionate operational expenditure in Cyprus | DR-10-004 |
| Local directors | Majority of directors tax-resident in Cyprus | DR-10-005 |

### 8.2 Enhanced Substance for Specific Activities

- **Holding companies:** Must have substance to manage holdings (not mere letterbox).
- **IP-holding entities:** Must satisfy nexus approach for IP Box; may need R&D staff.
- **Financing entities:** Must demonstrate decision-making and risk management capability.

<!-- EXPERT INPUT REQUIRED: Confirm whether Cyprus has adopted specific substance legislation (similar to Cayman/BVI) or relies on general anti-avoidance and treaty override provisions. -->

---
